        <h2>¿WHY FILTER THE COFFEE?</h2>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Article 1</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Concept 1:</strong>
                As we have already seen, currently the coffee industry in Mexico and in the world is committed to <br>
                improving processes, ensuring traceability and correct handling of the seed until it is roasted, all
                <br>
                this path requires that the methods to extract its aromatic and flavor compounds will adapt and evolve
                <br>
                so that they offer a <strong>better perspective, perception and experience to the final
                    consumer.</strong> <br>

            </p>
            <h3>Article 2</h3>
            <p>
                The main difference with the infusion or immersion methods is that in these the total water remains in
                <br>
                contact with the coffee particles for as long as is decided until the drink is strained by some means
                <br>
                and served. On the other hand, in filtering methods, the water passes through the coffee bed at a <br>
                certain speed that allows it to take with it the greatest amount of compounds, sediments, and solubles
                <br>
                from each coffee particle. <strong><em>This flow must be constant and balanced.</em></strong> , that is
                to say, it must have an <br>
                equal flow rate in each part of the coffee bed, this is achieved with a granulometry according to the
                <br>
                method and depending on the time it is expected to take to "wash" the coffee, another one also enters
                <br>
                variable such as turbulence, we will talk about these variables in more detail <br>

        <h2>¿WHAT VARIABLES INFLUENCE THE FILTERING?</h2>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Water temperature.</h3>
            <p>
                The temperature favors the volatilization of compounds, as well as the separation of these to be <br>
                transported to the final drink, <strong>the temperature in SCA parameters should be between 92° and
                    96°</strong> although <br>
                in recent times this range has been opened since It has been seen that temperatures above 65-70° favor
                <br>
                the extraction of some compounds, depending on the grain .
            </p>
            
            <h3>Turbulence.</h3>
            <p>
                This variable refers to the movement of the water, this is achieved by adding the water, in spiral or
                <br>
                similar movements, the force of this pouring and/or even with the use of a spoon or "shovel"
                <strong><em>(as in the <br>
                        case of the AeroPress ).</em></strong> The turbulence helps to increase the soluble action of
                the water, that is, it <br>
                increases the speed of extraction of the compounds from the coffee particles. This depends to a large
                <br>
                extent on the time that is decided for the final extraction, since strong turbulence in prolonged times
                <br>
                can result in over-extractions and bitter or unpleasant flavors, and on the contrary, little turbulence
                <br>
                and in a short time will give us under-extraction. extractions and flat flavors or with little <br>
                permanence in the mouth.
            </p>
            <h3>Extraction time.</h3>
            <p>
                It is one of the most important variables since the final result in the cup will depend on the time it
                <br>
                takes for the water to extract the compounds, short times could give flat flavors, and prolonged <br>
                extractions can result in strong, bitter or undesirable flavors. For the filtering methods, the times
                <br>
                range from <strong>2:00 to 5:00, depending on the method.</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Grinding or granulometry.</h3>
            <p>
                This variable is used to choose the <strong>"recipe"</strong> for each extraction, that is, the amount
                of coffee, water <br>
                and the time needed, a coarse grind will require longer times, as well as a fine grind, short times. As
                <br>
                we have already seen in previous deliveries.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose the right grinder: There are two main types of coffee grinders: blade grinders and burr <br>
                    grinders. Burr grinders are considered to be superior since they produce more consistent grounds, <br>
                    but they tend to be more expensive.
                </li>
                <li>Choose the grind size: The grind size you choose depends on the brewing method you will use. Coarser <br>
                    grinds are used for methods like French press, while finer grinds are used for espresso. <br>
                </li>
                <li>Measure the coffee: Measure out the amount of coffee you want to grind. Use a kitchen scale if<br>
                    possible for accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>Grind the coffee: Add the coffee beans to the grinder and grind them according to the desired grind<br>
                    size. Pulse the grinder in short bursts to prevent overheating the coffee.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Check the consistency: Check the grounds to make sure they are consistent in size. You may need to<br>
                    shake or tap the grinder to ensure all the beans are ground evenly.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Store the grounds: Once the coffee is ground, store it in an airtight container to prevent moisture <br>
                    and air from degrading the flavor.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Extraction ratio.</h3>
            <p>
                As we already saw in espresso, the ratio refers to the amount of water per coffee, for extractions ideal
                <br>
                ratios of 1:12 to 1:18 are considered, it all depends on the amount that we are going to prepare and
                <br>
                what we want to extract , short ratios give us intense extractions, and long ratios, flatter cups, like
                <br>
                a barista, <strong><em>over time ratios between 1:13.5 - 1:16.5 have had very good
                        results</em></strong>, of course depending on <br>
                the coffee and the method, however this We will only know this data based on the experimentation and
                <br>
                taste of the barista or coffee enthusiast. <br>

        <h2>Method and filter.</h2>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>¿What is?</h3>
            <p>
                In general, the filtering methods are cones or semi-cones in which paper filters are placed (although
                <br>
                there are also metal, cloth or glass filters), the angle of the cone, as well as the shape of the walls
                <br>
                <strong>(as in the V60 whose name is taken from the 60° angle of the cone, and that on its inner face it
                    <br>
                    presents spiral grooves that favor the extraction flow)</strong>, as well as the quality of the
                filter paper and <br>
                its shape directly influence the flow of water and the amount of solubles and sediments that pass or not
                <br>
                towards the final drink. It is important to know the method we use and the quality of its filters in
                <br>
                order to better choose the methodology to follow. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Chemex.</h3>
            <p>
                The Chemex method is known for producing a clean, bright cup of coffee with a lighter body and a crisp
                <br>
                finish. <strong>The thicker filter removes more oils and sediment from the coffee, resulting in a
                    clearer and <br>
                    more delicate flavor profile.</strong> The Chemex is a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts and
                is often used <br>
                in specialty coffee shops and homes for manual brewing. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Dripper V60</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>V60 method is known for producing a clean</strong>, crisp cup of coffee with a bright and
                nuanced flavor <br>
                profile. The cone shape and ridges of the dripper promote a more even extraction of the coffee, while
                <br>
                the paper filter removes some of the oils and sediment, resulting in a clearer and more delicate taste.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>AeroPress</h3>
            <p>
                The Aeropress method is known for producing a clean, smooth, and rich cup of coffee with a low acidity
                <br>
                and minimal bitterness. The plunger creates a vacuum that helps to extract the coffee evenly, while the
                <br>
                paper filter removes sediment and oils, <strong><em>resulting in a clear and consistent flavor
                        profile.</em></strong> <br>
            </p>
            <h3>French press</h3>
            <p>
                The French press method <strong>is known for producing a full-bodied, rich, and flavorful cup of
                    coffee.</strong> The <br>
                metal or nylon mesh filter allows for more oils and flavors to pass through into the final cup, <br>
                resulting in a coffee with a full and complex flavor profile. However, the French press can sometimes
                <br>
                produce coffee with sediment or grounds in the cup, which some people may find unappealing. <br>
            </p>

                <li>Ligth roast</li>
                <li>Medium roast</li>
                <li>Medium-Dark roast</li>
